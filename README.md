Tools developed by me


• How the program is developed.

	• Program includes Biopython, Tkinter and PyQt Libraries.

	• Biopython is used for all the text processing and calculation of protein Molecular Weight/pI.

	• Tkinter is used to make the file input/output easy.

	• PyQt is used for making the GUI and Plots.


• Program Algorithm:

	1. Program takes a "FASTA" file input.
	2. Processes the text and separates all the ribosomal proteins.
	3. Calculates the Mwt/pI of each ribosomal protein.
	4. Plots them from 2kDa to 20kDa.
	5. Exports the results into a CSV file.
